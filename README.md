Desktop view would have a static menu navigation, along with the following chronologic order from top to bottom: Head, nav, main+facebook feed, footer
See ![Alt text](image-link "Title") for context

## (Suggest title)
The tags like <main> contain the following:

- A header with the logo and the wave animation.
- A nav bar with static link boxes (not <button> btw). This will transform into a hamburger menu on mobile
- Main will contain the contents of the website. It is where we replace content when the user clicks on a link and the new "page" loads. Use the following syntax to point to the main HTML tag and HTML content: ```document.getElementsByTagName("main").innerHTML = "value"```
- Aside tag with the facebook feed. This will move above/below main when viewing the website on a mobile phone.
- Footer will contain certain links, copyright, and a "seperate" section above it with the newsletter signup.

## Aestethic and structure

- A background animation with slow water waves. 

## MVC and folder structure
